        Here is the Context Chain, it contains all messages from the user and plugin response. Your job is to find the content
        that the user or plugin wants to upload to the database for future use and generate a response with just that information.
        Make sure to keep the content exactly how it was presented by the user or plugin.

        Example of a valid response:

        Here is the context chain, it contains all messages from the user and plugin responses. Your job is to construct
        a query on the sandbox table that satisifes the users or plugins request outlined in the context chain.
        Make sure to only respond with the documnet ids that match the query.
